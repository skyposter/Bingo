## l10n
This Plugin features a Localization System which allows you to edit the game messages based on the users client language.
To do so go into the localization folder inside the Plugins data directory (`server/plugins/Bingo/localization`) and edit the files.
To add your own language you have to look up its [Language Code](https://minecraft-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Languages). 
Inside the Localization Directory create a file called
`[code].yml` and copy the contents of `en_us.yml`. Now you can translate it into your own language.

Contributions to the Plugins Native Languages(Currently only English and German) are also welcome.
To Contribute, fork the project and add your language files [here](src/main/resources/localization)
and follow the procedure described above.
After that you can open a Pull request.
